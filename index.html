                            <p>Harrisonburg, previously known as “Rocktown”, was named for Thomas Harrison, an English settler who in 1737 settled in the Shenandoah Valley. Harrisonburg is an independent city that lies in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley region of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. Home to institutions like James Madison University, a public research university with an enrollment of over 20,000 students, and Eastern Mennonite University, a private liberal arts University. Being a city with ethnic and linguistic diversity, Harrisonburg City Public Schools students speak 55 languages in addition to English, we have Arabic, Kurdish, Spanish and so much more. The popular language learning software company Rosetta Stone was founded in Harrisonburg in 1992, and the “Welcome Your Neighbors” yard sign was originated here in 2016. <br> 
                            Full of different cultures, ethnicities, and nationalities, the people of Harrisonburg welcome others with open arms. With many different public parks, outdoor recreational activities, and public schools, it's a perfect enviornment to raise kids.

                            James Madison University, a public research university, was created by The Virginia General Assembly in 1908 as an Industrial School for Women. Later, it became the State Teachers College in 1925, then renamed Madison College in 1938. It was then in 1977, when the college took on the name of James Madison University (JMU). James Madison University offers programs on the bachelors, masters and doctoral levels. At JMU, change is the status quo, with JMU students, faculty and alumni working together to create a brighter future for global society. JMU is a big part of the Harrisonburg community, making the town full of activiy and life!

                          <p class="lead">Understanding that success requires equal parts of intellect and action, JMUs motto is Being the Change. According the the university, “JMU graduates are far more than merely educated. They have honed their ability to think critically. They have learned the importance of a strong work ethic and have become committed to and skilled at collaborating with others. Diplomas in hand, they leave campus determined to live lives of meaning and pursue careers of purpose.” With many clubs ranging from snowboarding to painting, and club sports teams, JMU is a community of active and hands-on individuals that all share a common characteristic- a DUKE! <br>
